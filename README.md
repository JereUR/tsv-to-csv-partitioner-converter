You must create 3 folders:
The first will be 'data-file' where you will have to place the tsv file that you want to partition and convert. 
Then a 'results-chunks' folder where the partitioned tsv files were saved.
Finally a 'results-csv' folder where the partitioned csv files were saved.

After that run `node index.js` and thats it.
